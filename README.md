# UltraMinimalBarcodeSVG
Barcode to SVG for embroidery
 If you are looking to use a machine to embroider barcodes then this HTML file produces minimal lines from a barcode saved as an SVG file. Inkscape Ink/Stitch can then turn it into a series of lines. It is about the fastest way to embroider a 2D barcode.
 Have fun!
