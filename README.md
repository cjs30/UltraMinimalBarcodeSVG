<h1>Barcode to SVG for Embroidery Machines</h1>

<p>If you are looking to use a machine for embroidering barcodes then this might be useful.<br>
 It is an HTML file (open in a browser) and it produces minimal lines from a barcode and saves it as an SVG file.<br>
 Inkscape Ink/Stitch can then turn it into a series of lines. It is about the fastest way to embroider a 2D barcodes.</p>
 Have fun!
